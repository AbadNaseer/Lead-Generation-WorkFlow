BPMN Workflow for Lead Management & Sales Automation
Lead Capture via Landing Pages:

The process starts with a User Task where visitors interact with Landing Pages designed to capture lead information (name, email, phone number).
Once the lead information is captured, it is passed to the CRM System (Data Store) for seamless storage and tracking.
Automated SMS and Email Campaigns:

A Timer Intermediate Event triggers the next step within 24 hours after a lead subscribes or shows interest.
An Automated Task sends an introductory SMS or email, followed by a Conditional Flow based on the leadâ€™s interaction with the message (e.g., clicks a link or replies).
Based on engagement, a User Task sets up a personalized follow-up, and non-responsive leads proceed to the next reminder step.
Engagement Funnel Setup:

An Exclusive Gateway evaluates the client's engagement (email/SMS interaction).
Leads who engage are nurtured through further communications. Those who do not receive an Automated Reminder after 48 hours.
Sales Process Automation:

For engaged leads, a User Task schedules a sales call or meeting using scheduling tools. This step is automated.
After the sales call, Automated Tasks send proposals or contracts, and a follow-up sequence is triggered to ensure the deal closure.
Conversion and Reporting:

Once a client accepts the proposal, a Business Rule Task marks them as successfully converted in the CRM system.
If a lead remains unresponsive, they are tagged as "Cold" for further action in the strategy.
